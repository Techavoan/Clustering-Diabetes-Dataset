The following clustering project was completed as part of the final project requirement for STAT 576 Data Informatics. The project aims to use unsupervised machine learning algorithms to determine the best clustering based on Silhouette Score and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). 

The project uses the Diabetes 130-US Hospital dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

In order to optimize both the Silhouette Score and the ARI, hyperparameter tuning was used.
